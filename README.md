### Installation of required tools
#### About IcarusVerilog
Icarus Verilog is an open-source hardware description language (HDL) compiler and simulator. It is commonly used in digital design and verification to model and simulate hardware circuits written in the Verilog HDL. Iverilog can be utilized for various purposes, including digital system design, FPGA programming, ASIC development, and hardware verification.
One of the key advantages of Icarus Verilog is its open-source nature, enabling users to access and modify the source code to suit their specific needs. Additionally, it is widely used within the digital design community due to its efficiency and robustness, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced engineers in the field of digital hardware design.

#### About GTKWave
GTKWave is an open-source waveform viewer for digital signals and simulation results. It is commonly used in digital design and hardware verification to visualize and analyze waveforms generated by simulation tools like Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, and other HDL simulators.

The required tools IcarusVerilog, GTKWave tools can be installed with the following command.
```
sudo apt-get install iverilog gtkwave
```

#### About Yosys
Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog synthesis. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains. Yosys can be adapted to perform any synthesis job by combining the existing passes (algorithms) using synthesis scripts and adding additional passes as needed by extending the Yosys C++ code base.

To install YoSys Synthesis tool, type the following in your terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git
cd yosys 
sudo apt install make (If make is not installed please install it) 
sudo apt-get install build-essential clang bison flex \
    libreadline-dev gawk tcl-dev libffi-dev git \
    graphviz xdot pkg-config python3 libboost-system-dev \
    libboost-python-dev libboost-filesystem-dev zlib1g-dev
make config-gcc
make 
sudo make install
```
